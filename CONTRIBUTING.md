# Contributing

A PR is the beginning of a conversation that will hopefully result in a new release of safe-shrinkwrap. The maintainers and other contributors are here to help you get it ready for release. Sometimes the conversation will end with no changes... but most of the time they will result in a new release.

If this is your first time committing to OSS welcome! Don't worry about if you're doing it right, you are. We're excited to help you make it happen!

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/). If you aren't sure what version number to use - just ask! :) 
4. The maintainers will merge the PR once everything is working and ready to go out into the world.
